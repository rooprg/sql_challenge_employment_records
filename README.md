**SQL CHALLENGE**


**(1) Project Overview and Purpose:**

This is exercise relates to Human Resources research regarding people whom a company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. Only historical information remains and the research is design the tables to hold the data from the source files, import them into a SQL database, and then answer certain questions about the data.


**(2) Dataset Description:**

The historical HR files are comprised of 6 .csv files:


(a) "departments.csv" contains Department Numbers and Department Names


(b) "titles.csv" contains Title Identifiers and Titles


(c) "employees.csv" contains Employee Numbers; Employee Title Identifiers; Employee Birth Dates; Employee First and Last Names; Employee Genders; and Employee Hire Dates


(d) "dept_manager.csv" contains Department Numbers and Employee Numbers for the respective managers


(e) "dept_emp.csv" contains Employee Numbers and their Department Numbers


(f) "emp_no.csv" contains Employee Numbers and their salaries


**(3) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

The information stored in the above six .csv files is complete, as not missing or partial data is present.

Table schema were created for each of the six .csv files (including adding any primary and/or foreign keys). Each .csv file was then imported into SQL


**(4) Data Visualization Techniques:**


An Entity Relationship Diagram [ERD] was generated based on the information found in the 6 tables using QuickDBD [https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/].




**(5) Results and Analysis:**


(a) ERD

**(6) Ethical Considerations:**

(Discuss any ethical considerations taken into account during the project, such as data privacy, bias, or fairness)


**(7) Instructions for Interacting with the Project:**

(Provide clear instructions on how to interact with the visualizations, such as how to run the code or access the visualizations)


**(8) Citations:**

Several questions asked of Xpert Learning Assistant on the following topics:


(1) syntax checks on code written by student


(2) advice on correctly saving and retrieving .sql files


(3) how to find dates from a list within a certain range of dates instead of AND or less than (<) / greater than (>) attempts
